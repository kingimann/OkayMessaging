# Okay Messaging — a WhatsApp clone in Flutter

A UI-focused WhatsApp clone built with Flutter. It reproduces the core
WhatsApp experience — chat list, conversation view with bubbles and delivery
ticks, Status (stories), Calls log, contact info, and settings with a
light/dark theme toggle — running entirely on in-memory mock data (no backend).

## Features

- **Chats tab** — conversation list with avatars, last-message preview,
  timestamps, unread badges, pinned chats, and delivery ticks.
- **Conversation screen** — WhatsApp-style message bubbles (incoming/outgoing),
  day separators, delivery status ticks (sent → delivered → read), a working
  composer, and a simulated auto-reply so the demo feels alive.
- **Status tab** — "My status" plus recent and viewed updates with story rings.
- **Calls tab** — call log with incoming/outgoing/missed indicators and
  voice/video icons.
- **Contact info** — collapsing header, about, phone, and actions.
- **Settings** — profile row and a **dark/light theme switch** wired through
  the whole app.
- **Light & dark themes** matching WhatsApp's palette.

## Running the app

The Android, iOS, and web platform folders are included, so the project runs
straight after cloning.

1. Install Flutter (3.0 or newer): https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
2. Fetch dependencies and run:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutter run          # pick a device, or use -d chrome for web
   ```

3. Run the tests:

   ```bash
   flutter test
   ```

> Built and verified against Flutter 3.44 / Dart 3.12. `flutter analyze` is
> clean and the widget tests pass.

## Notes

- **UI only.** There is no server, database, or real networking. Messages you
  send are held in memory for the session and a canned auto-reply is generated
  to demonstrate the ticks and scrolling.
- Avatars are colored initials placeholders, so the app ships with no image
  assets and no network calls.
